# stanford-machine-learning-solutions-python
This repository contains all the solutions to the programming exercises of the Stanford's Machine Learning course taught on Coursera by Andrew Ng. It also contains the implementations of Stochastic and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent algorithms taught in the week 10 of the same course.

## Setup and Usage

- Clone this repo to your desktop.
- Create a new anaconda environment with all the requirements using the following command:

      conda env create -f environment.yml
      
- After the new environment is set up, activate it using (windows)

      activate machine_learning
   
  or if you are on a linux machine

      source activate machine_learning

- Navigate to the directory where the assignments were installed, and launch the jupyter notebook from the terminal using the command:

      jupyter notebook


## Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank professor Andrew Ng and the crew of the Stanford Machine Learning class on Coursera for such an awesome class.
- I would like to thank [Gerges Dib](https://github.com/dibgerge) for the robust implementation of the course's assignments in python.
